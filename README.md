# mars

Last year by far the best movie I saw at the cinema was "The Martian", known in China as "Mars Rescue" and shown a few months after its release in the US. After looking around at some calendaring systems for Mars, I found none of them suitable so I invented one myself.

The concepts of "Martian day" and "Martian year" are quite intuitive, and form the basis of this calendar.

## Intra-day

The system used by US robotic missions to Mars of making the Martian second 2.75% longer than the Earth second is a good system, so there's 60 Martian seconds in a Martian minute, 60 of those in a Martian hour, and 24 of those in a Martian day, called a "sol". The Martian time zone used by US missions is whatever puts the Sun directly overhead at Martian noon, but perhaps later on Mars should be divided into 24 time zones.

## Week

The 7-day week has been around for at least 2,500 years, and is now standardized by virtually every society on Earth. A 7-sol week would also be a natural choice for Mars, but there's one additional feature of a Martian week which would make it special, and forms the basis for the subsequent decisions in designing this calendaring system: *The day of the week on Mars should be the same as the current day of week on Earth*.

Because 1 Martian "sol" is the same as 1 day and 40 minutes on Earth, matching the Martian day of week to the Earth one will cause a 1-sol slip around every 37 sols, so a day of week will need to be skipped to reset the Martian day of week back to the Earth one. A second design decision is that *the same day of week should be skipped each time*. Because the present international standard is that Monday is the first day of the week and Sunday the seventh, perhaps it's best that the last day of the week, Sunday, be skipped. This would happen once every 5 or 6 weeks.

## Month

There should be a time period roughly matching what's known as a month on Earth. The third design decision is that *a Martian month would end whenever a Sunday is skipped*. So a Martian month would always be 34 or 41 days long. On average, every third month would be 41 days long, and the other two 34 days long. Because a Martian year is about 668 sols long, this puts the number of Martian months per Martian year as usually 18 and sometimes 19.

The timing and name of a Martian month could roughly follow those on Earth, or they could follow the seasons on Mars, or perhaps a bit of both. We've tried to do both in our fourth design decision: *every second Martian month name will match the current month on Earth, and every other Martian month will match the seasons on Mars*. Tentatively, we've used the English month names January to December for the Earth months, and the Horoscope signs Aries to Pisces for the seasons on Mars. The same Earth month name won't be used twice only one Earth year apart but forward to the following Earth month if necessary. Therefore, all month names in a single Martian year will be unique.

## Year

I've written a quick script in Golang to look at the distribution of month names using these rules over 25 Martian years. Aries marks the beginning of Northern Spring, and the distorted season lengths on Mars are accounted for...

Jan:22, Feb:16, Mar:16, Apr:19, May:20, Jun:21, Jul:19, Aug:19, Sep:20, Oct:18, Nov:18, Dec:22, 
Ari:21, Tau:21, Gem:23, Can:20, Leo:21, Vir:17, Lib:15, Sco:18, Sag:15, Cap:16, Aqu:21, Pis:22, 
```

The least frequent seasonal month names are Libra and Saggitarius, which matches winter and autumn being the shortest months on Mars. February, the shortest month on Earth, is also among the least frequent Earth-month-named months on Mars.

The full data, where a `+` after the month name denotes a 41-day month...

## Summary of Rules

* The day of the week on Mars should be the same as the current day of week on Earth

* The same day of week should be skipped each time

* A Martian month would end whenever a Sunday is skipped

* Every second Martian month name will match the current month on Earth, and every other Martian month will match the seasons on Mars

Of course there's many more rules we could add to fine-tune the idea. When the Earth is closest to Mars, we could have two consecutive Earth-month-named Martian months, and when Earth is furthest away, have two consecutive season-named Martian months. But these rules roughly show how the 24 month names would be distributed. And this is assuming there's no flaws in my program.
